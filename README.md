# Radio astronomy tutorial
A developing tutorial for radio astronomy and radio transient search 

Currently, this repository consists of 3 google collab notebook which are 

## Pulsar search tutorial 

Filename: revis_pulsar_search.ipynb
This notebook aim for beginner to understand different pulsar search algorithm including the Fast Fourier transform (FFA) and the Fast Folding algorithm (FFA)

## Radio Transient search tutorial
Filename: AIAT-tutorial-transient_search_TH.ipynb

This notebook aim for university students that have a basic understanding about a radio phenomenon called dispersion, Fourier transform and basic statistic. 
Currently, it is partially in Thai. 

## Radio telescope and radio interferometer basic
